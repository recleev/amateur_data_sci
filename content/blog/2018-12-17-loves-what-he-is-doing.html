<p>More than two years ago, 2016 November, I started learning <code>R</code> as part of a company push to be more data centric in our decision making. I found programming difficult to learn, but the opportunity <code>R</code> and data science offered encouraged me to continue pursuing it. Soon, I was able to apply <code>R</code> and data science to my work.</p>
<p>Last 2018 December 3, I started a new role as a junior data scientist in the research and development department. I use <code>R</code> everyday at work to analyse and interpret data.</p>
<p><strong>The amateur is now a professional.</strong> I am not yet in the first month of my new role, I already have my hands full in data and <code>R</code>. I enjoy it, and I am happy to be someone to work with something that I <strong>love</strong>.</p>
<p>It will take me some time to adapt with my new role, not to mention my new shift, so I do not know how often I can still post. I hope to get my groove back by mid-January or early February. I will do my best to work with data and <code>R</code> as a hobby even if I work with <code>R</code> and data now for a living.</p>
