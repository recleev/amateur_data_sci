# MongoDB at Work

Some of the most important data I use at work are stored and access in [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/). We also use SQL^[I am not familiar of the advantages and disadvantages of MongoDB and SQL as I am only a novice in both database programs. However, I like both, and I aim to be proficient at least in the way I can obtain data from them. SQL and MongoDB are just the few learning opportunities I now face at work.], but I often find myself reliant on using MongoDB most of the time since my shift to a data science role.

In most of the things I do for work, I don't need all the available data. Filtering is a common task and one of the most common ways to filter data is by date.
