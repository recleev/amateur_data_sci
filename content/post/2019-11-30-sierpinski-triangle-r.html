<h1>Chaos Game</h1>
<p>I learned about this <a href="https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2017/07/08/the-chaos-game-and-the-sierpinski-triangle/">chaos game</a> to draw a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpi%C5%84ski_triangle">Sierpinski triangle</a>.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Select a random point within a triangle.</li>
<li>Select a random vertex.</li>
<li>Move to the midpoint of that point and the vertex.</li>
<li>From the new point, repeat 1.</li>
<li>Keep doing 1 to 4 until you draw a Sierpinski trianle.</li>
</ol>
<p>Cook provided the Python code he used to play the game and draw the Siepinski triangle. I became curious how I can replicate this process in <code>R</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>set.seed(1915)

triangle_points &lt;- expand.grid(
  step = 1:10000,
  # Vertices of the triangle are the origin (0, 0)
  x1 = 0, 
  y1 = 0, 
  # (1, 0) on the x-axis
  x2 = 1, 
  y2 = 0, 
  # next point is between the origin and x = 1 plus the height of the
  # equilateral triangle. Since for an equilateral triangle, we know the sides
  # are all equal to one, because the base is one, and the opposite side of the
  # triangle&#39;s height is 60 degrees or pi/2.
  x3 = 0.5, 
  y3 = sin(pi/2)
)</code></pre>
