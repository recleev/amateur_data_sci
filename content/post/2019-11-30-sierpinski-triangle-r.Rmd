# Chaos Game

I learned about this [chaos game](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2017/07/08/the-chaos-game-and-the-sierpinski-triangle/) to draw a [Sierpinski triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpi%C5%84ski_triangle).

1. Select a random point within a triangle.
2. Select a random vertex.
3. Move to the midpoint of that point and the vertex.
4. From the new point, repeat 1.
5. Keep doing 1 to 4 until you draw a Sierpinski trianle.

Cook provided the Python code he used to play the game and draw the Siepinski triangle. I became curious how I can replicate this process in `R`.

```{r draw-sierpinski-triangle}

set.seed(1915)

find_midpoint <- function(point1, point2){
  a <- min(point1[1], point2[1])
  b <- min(point1[2], point2[2])
  x <- a + sqrt((point2[1] - point1[1])^2) / 2
  y <- b + sqrt((point2[2] - point1[2])^2) / 2
  
  c(x, y)
}

triangle_points <- expand.grid(
  step = 1:10000,
  # Vertices of the triangle are the origin (0, 0)
  x1 = 0, 
  y1 = 0, 
  # (1, 0) on the x-axis
  x2 = 1, 
  y2 = 0, 
  # next point is between the origin and x = 1 plus the height of the
  # equilateral triangle. Since for an equilateral triangle, we know the sides
  # are all equal to one, because the base is one, and the opposite side of the
  # triangle's height is 60 degrees or pi/2.
  x3 = 0.5, 
  y3 = sin(pi/2)
)

```
