# Problem

Problem 40, page 157 in @cwag2016

Consider the general cubic equation $y = a x^3 + b x^2 + c x + d$. Show that:

1. It has one and only one point of inflection at $I (\frac{-b}{3a}, k); k = \frac{2 b^3}{27 a^2} - \frac{bc}{3a} + d$,
2. It has one maximum point and one minimum point if and only if $b^2 - 3ac \gt 0$,
3. The abscissa of $I$ is the average of the abscissas of the maximum and minimum point, and
4. The curve is symmetric with respect to $I$ by
    a. Introducing a new $X$-axis and $Y$-axis such that $X = x + \frac{b}{3a}$ and $Y = y - k$ and making $I$ as the origin of the $XY$-system,
    b. Showing that the equation of the curve in the $XY$-system is $Y = aX \left(X^2 - \frac{b^2 - 3ac}{3 a^2} \right)$, and
    c. Showing that this transformed equation is symmetric with respect to $I$.
