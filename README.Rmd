> An amateur...is someone not quite up to par, a person not to be taken seriously, one whose performance falls short of professional standards. But originally, "amateur", from the Latin verb *amare*, "to love", referred to a person who loved what he was doing.

I started learning R in November 2016. I never stopped learning it and using it since then. R has reawakened my interest in statistics and fueled my life-long pursuit in learning. I use R and data science at work, but I do not feel like a professional data scientist. Working with R and data does not feel like work. I do it because I love it. I do it because of my love for knowledge. Here, I share all my thoughts and outputs in working with data in different topics including sports, literature, music, economics, statistics, and science.

This is the repo for my blog dedicated to R and data science created with [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) and the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) theme [Blackburn](https://themes.gohugo.io/blackburn/).
