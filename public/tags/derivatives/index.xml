Consider the general cubic equation \(y = a x^3 + b x^2 + c x + d\). Show that:
It has one and only one point of inflection at \(I (\frac{-b}{3a}, k); k = \frac{2 b^3}{27 a^2} - \frac{bc}{3a} + d\),It has one maximum point and one minimum point if and only if \(b^2 - 3ac \gt 0\),The abscissa of \(I\) is the average of the abscissas of the maximum and minimum point, andThe curve is symmetric with respect to \(I\) byIntroducing a new \(X\)-axis and \(Y\)-axis such that \(X = x + \frac{b}{3a}\) and \(Y = y - k\) and making \(I\) as the origin of the \(XY\)-system,Showing that the equation of the curve in the \(XY\)-system is \(Y = aX \left(X^2 - \frac{b^2 - 3ac}{3 a^2} \right)\), andShowing that this transformed equation is symmetric with respect to \(I\).</description>

Newtonâ€™s second law of motion
\[F = ma = m \frac{dv}{dt}\]
can be written in the form
\[\begin{equation}F = \frac{d \left( mv \right)}{dt} \tag{1.1}\end{equation}\]
in terms of the momentum \(mv\) of a particle of mass \(m\) and velocity \(v\), and remains valid even if \(m\) is not constant.</description>

      <description>1 From Product to Quotient1.1 Product Rule of Differentiation1.2 Quotient Rule of Differentiation1.3 Derive the Quotient Rule from the Product Rule2 Problems2.1 Extend the Product Rule and Prove2.2 Tangent Lines Intersecting on a Curve3 Reference1 From Product to QuotientI have always had a hard time remembering the quotient rule for derivatives. I do not know how I remembered it while studying calculus, but today I learned from Simmons (2016) that I can derive it from the product rule.</description>
