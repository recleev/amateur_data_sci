      <description>1 Problem2 Solution3 Reference1 ProblemProblem 49, page 189 in Simmons (2016)
Newtonâ€™s second law of motion
\[F = ma = m \frac{dv}{dt}\]
can be written in the form
\[\begin{equation}F = \frac{d \left( mv \right)}{dt} \tag{1.1}\end{equation}\]
in terms of the momentum \(mv\) of a particle of mass \(m\) and velocity \(v\), and remains valid even if \(m\) is not constant.</description>

      <description>1 Sliding Ladder1.1 Problem1.2 Solution2 Filling a Bowl2.1 Problem2.2 Solution3 References1 Sliding Ladder1.1 ProblemProblem 116, Page 142 in Simmons (2016)
A ladder 20 ft long is leaning against a wall 12 ft high, with its top projecting over the wall. Its bottom is being pulled away from the wall at the constant rate of 5 ft/min. Find how rapidly the top of the ladder is approaching the ground:</description>

      <description>1 From Product to Quotient1.1 Product Rule of Differentiation1.2 Quotient Rule of Differentiation1.3 Derive the Quotient Rule from the Product Rule2 Problems2.1 Extend the Product Rule and Prove2.2 Tangent Lines Intersecting on a Curve3 Reference1 From Product to QuotientI have always had a hard time remembering the quotient rule for derivatives. I do not know how I remembered it while studying calculus, but today I learned from Simmons (2016) that I can derive it from the product rule.</description>
