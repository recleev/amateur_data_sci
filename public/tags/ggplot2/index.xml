      <description>From Product to QuotientProduct Rule of DifferentiationQuotient Rule of DifferentiationDerive the Quotient Rule from the Product RuleProblemsExtend the Product Rule and ProveTangent Lines Intersecting on a CurveReferenceFrom Product to QuotientI have always had a hard time remembering the quotient rule for derivatives. I do not know how I remembered it while studying calculus, but today I learned from Simmons (2016) that I can derive it from the product rule.</description>
