      <description>Perpendicular Intersecting Waves (page 119, Problem 24)ProblemSolutionA Folded Paper (page 130, Problem 30)ProblemSolution: Minimum Arealibrary(knitr)library(tidyverse)library(ggthemes)opts_chunk$set(fig.align = &amp;quot;center&amp;quot;,message = FALSE,warning = FALSE)I found these two problems in Simmons (2016). I enjoyed these problems because they require more thinking than just a mechanical application of derivatives.
Perpendicular Intersecting Waves (page 119, Problem 24)ProblemFind \(a &amp;gt; 0\) so that the curves \(y = \sin {ax}\) and \(y=\cos {ax}\) intersect at right angles.</description>

      <description>From Product to QuotientProduct Rule of DifferentiationQuotient Rule of DifferentiationDerive the Quotient Rule from the Product RuleProblemsExtend the Product Rule and ProveTangent Lines Intersecting on a CurveReferenceFrom Product to QuotientI have always had a hard time remembering the quotient rule for derivatives. I do not know how I remembered it while studying calculus, but today I learned from Simmons (2016) that I can derive it from the product rule.</description>
