      <description>1 Problem2 Solution2.1 Inflection Point2.2 Maxima and Minima3 Reference1 ProblemProblem 40, page 157 in Simmons (2016)
Consider the general cubic equation
\[\begin{equation}y = a x^3 + b x^2 + c x + d\tag{1.1}\end{equation}\]
Show that:
It has one and only one point of inflection at \(I (\frac{-b}{3a}, k)\) where \(k = \frac{2 b^3}{27 a^2} - \frac{bc}{3a} + d\),It has one maximum point and one minimum point if and only if \(b^2 - 3ac \gt 0\),The abscissa of \(I\) is the average of the abscissas of the maximum and minimum point, andThe curve is symmetric with respect to \(I\) byIntroducing a new \(X\)-axis and \(Y\)-axis such that \(X = x + \frac{b}{3a}\) and \(Y = y - k\) and making \(I\) as the origin of the \(XY\)-system,Showing that the equation of the curve in the \(XY\)-system is \(Y = aX \left(X^2 - \frac{b^2 - 3ac}{3 a^2} \right)\), andShowing that this transformed equation is symmetric with respect to \(I\).</description>

      <description>1 Perpendicular Intersecting Waves1.1 Problem1.2 Solution2 A Folded Paper2.1 Problem2.2 Solution: Minimum Area2.3 Solution: Minimum Crease Length2.4 Solution: Using R (Without Differentiations)3 Referencelibrary(knitr)library(tidyverse)library(ggthemes)opts_chunk$set(fig.align = &amp;quot;center&amp;quot;,message = FALSE,warning = FALSE)I found these two problems in Simmons (2016). I enjoyed these problems because they require more thinking than just a mechanical application of derivatives.</description>
