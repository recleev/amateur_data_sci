      <description>1 Perpendicular Intersecting Waves1.1 Problem1.2 Solution2 A Folded Paper2.1 Problem2.2 Solution: Minimum Area2.3 Solution: Minimum Crease Length2.4 Solution: Using R (Without Differentiations)3 Referencelibrary(knitr)library(tidyverse)library(ggthemes)opts_chunk$set(fig.align = &amp;quot;center&amp;quot;,message = FALSE,warning = FALSE)I found these two problems in Simmons (2016). I enjoyed these problems because they require more thinking than just a mechanical application of derivatives.</description>

      <description>1 From Product to Quotient1.1 Product Rule of Differentiation1.2 Quotient Rule of Differentiation1.3 Derive the Quotient Rule from the Product Rule2 Problems2.1 Extend the Product Rule and Prove2.2 Tangent Lines Intersecting on a Curve3 Reference1 From Product to QuotientI have always had a hard time remembering the quotient rule for derivatives. I do not know how I remembered it while studying calculus, but today I learned from Simmons (2016) that I can derive it from the product rule.</description>
