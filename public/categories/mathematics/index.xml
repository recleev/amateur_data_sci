      <description>Sliding LadderProblemSolutionFilling a BowlProblemSolutionReferencesSliding LadderProblemProblem 116, Page 142 in Simmons (2016)
A ladder 20 ft long is leaning against a wall 1 2 ft high, with its top projecting over the wall. Its bottom is being pulled away from the wall at the constant rate of 5 ft/min. Find how rapidly the top of the ladder is approaching the ground - when 5 ft of the ladder projects over the wall; - when the top of the ladder reaches the top of the wall.</description>

      <description>Perpendicular Intersecting WavesProblemSolutionA Folded PaperProblemSolution: Minimum AreaSolution: Minimum Crease LengthSolution: Using R (Without Differentiations)Referencelibrary(knitr)library(tidyverse)library(ggthemes)opts_chunk$set(fig.align = &amp;quot;center&amp;quot;,message = FALSE,warning = FALSE)I found these two problems in Simmons (2016). I enjoyed these problems because they require more thinking than just a mechanical application of derivatives.
Perpendicular Intersecting WavesProblemThis problem appears in Simmons (2016) on page 119, item 24.</description>

      <description>From Product to QuotientProduct Rule of DifferentiationQuotient Rule of DifferentiationDerive the Quotient Rule from the Product RuleProblemsExtend the Product Rule and ProveTangent Lines Intersecting on a CurveReferenceFrom Product to QuotientI have always had a hard time remembering the quotient rule for derivatives. I do not know how I remembered it while studying calculus, but today I learned from Simmons (2016) that I can derive it from the product rule.</description>

      <description>Definition of a Tangent LineSlope of a Tangent Line on a CurveCondition for ExistenceLimit of an Absolute ValueProblemSolutionReferenceDefinition of a Tangent LineConsider a curve \(y = f(x)\), and let \(P\) be a given fixed point on this curve. Let \(Q\) be a second nearby point on the curve, and draw the secant line \(PQ\). The tangent line at \(P\) can now be thought of as the limiting position of the variable secant as \(Q\) slides along the curve toward \(P\).</description>
