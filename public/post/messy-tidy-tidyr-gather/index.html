<h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Tidy Data: Long But Machine Readable</h1>
<p>Working with data made me conscious of how we compile, store, and share data. Most of us work with spreadsheets and most of the time we encode our data in a way that makes it easy for other people to read our data. Unfortunately, human readable data format is not necessarily machine readable data. When we want to work with data in code, human readable data is not usually the best form to begin with and to share with other people who wants to reproduce our work.</p>
<p><span class="citation">Wickham (2014)</span> has the following definition of a <a href="http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.html">tidy data</a>:</p>
<p>Data is tidy when</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Every column is a variable,</li>
<li>Every row is an observation, and</li>
<li>Every observational unit forms a table.</li>
</ol>
<p>Data that is not tidy is <em>messy</em>.</p>
<p><span class="citation">Ellis and Leek (2014)</span> also advocates tidy data principles and good practices when <a href="https://peerj.com/preprints/3139/">sharing data</a> for collaboration.</p>
<p>I wanted to discuss these three properties in the context of a real world data in one post, but the data I will work with is quite messy, not the messiest I have seen, but messy enough for me to work on a lot of things. This post will be the first post in the “From Messy to Tidy” series.</p>

<div id="consumer-price-index-of-the-philippines" class="section level1">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Consumer Price Index of the Philippines</h1>
<p>The data I will use here is the Philippines consumer price index from 1994 Jan to 2018 Jun retrieved <a href="http://openstat.psa.gov.ph/dataset/prices-and-related-indices">here</a> on 2018 Sep 28.

Figure 2.1: First 20 Rows of the Philippines Monthly Consumer Price Index (CPI) for All Income Households by Commodity Group and Geographic Area from 1994 Jan to 2018 Jun. CPI from 1994 to 2005 are the equivalent/estimated 2006-based CPI using the splicing method. Data from Philippine Statistics Authority (<a href="http://openstat.psa.gov.ph" class="uri">http://openstat.psa.gov.ph</a>).
</p>
</div>
<p>According to the <a href="http://openstat.psa.gov.ph/">Philippine Statistics Authority</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Consumer Price Index (CPI) - is an indicator of the change in the average retail prices of a fixed basket of goods and services commonly purchased by households relative to a base year.CPI stands for the percentage change in the average prices of goods and services commonly bought by a group of consumers from the base year.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The initial reason why I looked at this data was because of the high inflation rates the Philippines is experiencing in 2018. However, after I saw how the data looked, I became more interested in using it to discuss tidy data principles and ways to turn a data set from messy to tidy.</p>

<p>Usually, tidy data takes the form of a long table. This is just a consequence of keeping variables in columns and observations in rows. A wide table, like Figure <a href="#fig:show-raw-data-sample">2.1</a>, is a common cue that a data is not tidy. The CPI data has 324 columns and 12,095 rows. The dimensions may indicate a long table already, but we must further investigate; 324 columns is just too many to be just variables.</p>
</div>
<div id="dates-as-columns" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Dates as Columns</h2>
<p>One of the common ways of making a data set messy is by creating columns that are not variables but values of a certain observation, which happens quite often with dates. In the CPI data, there are 294 columns that are month and year data, not even in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601">ISO 8601</a> format (YYYY-MM-DD). Under each date column is supposed to be the consumer price index for that month and year. Putting variables under variables is not the tidy way.</p>
</div>
<div id="average-columns" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.3</span> Average Columns</h2>
<p>Before I do something about these dates, I also noticed that there are <code>Ave_yy</code> columns. These columns show the average CPI for each year.</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Ran on software</li>
<li>Modify data</li>
<li>Remove data</li>
<li>Summarise data</li>
</ol>
<p>I can only assume that the data encoder of the CPI data followed the first three conditions. There are missing values, but I think it was missing in the first place rather than removed. I am sure that the <code>Ave_yy</code> summarizes the data. Manipulating data to obtain any statistical value like the average is easy for any data analyst when the raw data is tidy or at least near tidy. Having summary columns are not only unnecessary, but it also may lead the data analyst into checking what these columns mean<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>. From the definition of CPI, I also don’t think that the annual average is a necessary and correct value to consider.</p>

<div id="remove-columns-with-names-that-starts-with-the-same-characters" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Remove Columns with Names that Starts with the Same Characters</h2>
<p><code>dplyr::select()</code> <span class="citation">(Wickham et al. 2018)</span> allows for selecting or removing columns by column names. There are 24 <code>Ave_yy</code> columns. Listing them one-by-one is bothersome.</p>
<p><code>dplyr::starts_with()</code> <span class="citation">(Wickham et al. 2018)</span> offers one way to remove the <code>Ave_yy</code> columns. As the function name implies, <code>dplyr::starts_with()</code> selects all column names that begin with the specified string prefix. We can remove 24 <code>Ave_yy</code> columns using two simple functions. Just don’t forget the <code>-</code> to tell select that we want the columns removed not selected. I also removed the extra and empty <code>X324</code> column.</p>
</div>
<div id="gather-the-date-columns" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Gather the Date Columns</h2>
<p>Converting a table from wide to long format is possible with <code>tidyr::gather()</code> <span class="citation">(Wickham and Henry 2018)</span>. It takes four important arguments: the wide <code>data</code>, the <code>key</code> or column name we want to call the the column names we are gathering, the <code>value</code> or the column name we want to call the variables under the columns we will collect, and <code>...</code> or the set of column names we want to gather.</p>
<p>Since the column names we want to gather are in <code>month_year</code> form, it is appropriate to call the “key” column “month_year”. The values under the <code>month_year</code> columns are the CPI for each month; the appropriate “value” column is “cpi”.</p>
<p>There are 294 <code>month_year</code> columns, so listing them one-by-one is more bothersome than listing the <code>Ave_yy</code> columns. <code>dplyr::starts_with()</code> will not help us here because it needs a specific string to match as prefix. The <code>month_year</code> columns have different beginnings (i.e. Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov, and Dec). In situations like this, we will need the help of <code>dplyr::matches()</code> <span class="citation">(Wickham et al. 2018)</span>. Instead of a specific string prefix, <code>dplyr::matches()</code> finds column names that matches a regular expression anywhere in the column name.</p>
<p>The mention of regular expressions might have disturbed the balance of the universe, but nothing to worry, <code>{rebus}</code> <span class="citation">(Cotton 2017)</span> is here. With the <code>month.abb</code> (built-in vector of three-letter abbreviations of English month names) and <code>paste()</code>, we can create the regular expression to select all the <code>month_year</code> columns with <code>paste(month.abb %R% &quot;_&quot; %R% DGT %R% DGT, collapes = &quot;|&quot;)</code><a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>. I used <code>collapse = &quot;|&quot;</code> because <code>dplyr::matches()</code> only takes one regular expression as argument, and <code>|</code> is interpreted as the “or”&quot; separator.</p>

Figure 4.1: The Data so Far. No Ave_yy Columns and month_year Columns Gathered in One Column.
</p>
</div>
<p>Looking good so far. The data went from wide (324 rows by 12,095 columns) to long (7 rows by 3,555,930 columns) in just a few lines of code. However, the <code>month_year</code> column is still not in ISO 8601 format. This step will be tricky.</p>
</div>
<div id="convert-to-yyyy-mm-dd" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.3</span> Convert to YYYY-MM-DD</h2>
<p>Years in the CPI data are abbreviated to only the last two digits of the year. This makes it very difficult for future encoding of data. What happens when the data goes beyond 2094 or if we obtained data since 1800? This is another reason why ISO 8601 format is preferable, there is no confusion about the year because it is spelled out. However, this is why we are tidying the data, so that future data analysts and gatherers can update the data with consistency and ease.</p>
<p>To manipulate the two-digit years, I first split the <code>month_year</code> column to <code>month</code> and <code>year</code> using <code>tidyr::separate()</code> <span class="citation">(Wickham and Henry 2018)</span>. With the two-digit <code>year</code> column, I added 1900 when years are in the 90s and 2000 otherwise.</p>
<p>I like working with dates using <code>{lubridate}</code> <span class="citation">(Spinu, Grolemund, and Wickham 2018)</span>. A “YYYY-MM-DD” string can be converted to a YYYY-MM-DD date with <code>lubridate::ymd()</code>. Since the original CPI data only had months and year, and we can assume that these end-of-month CPI values, I had to arbitrarily add a day field. I used 1 because all months begin with 1; months end at different days, then there is also the leap year. My initial date is <code>ymd(paste(year, month, 1, sep = &quot;-&quot;))</code>. To convert this to end-of-month dates, I used <code>lubridate::ceiling_date()</code>, specifying <code>unit = &quot;month&quot;</code> for rounding-up by month. However, <code>lubridate::ceiling_date()</code> rounds up a month to the first day of the next month (see the <code>?lubridate::ceiling_date()</code> for more information). To obtain the real end-of-month date, I had to subtract a period of 1 day using <code>lubridate::days(1)</code>.</p>
<p>Converting to ISO 8601 looks easier in code, but it was a tricky process to get here when you are just thinking about how to handle the messy data for the first time.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>I wanted to verify if the <code>Ave_yy</code> columns are really the average of the CPI for each year. However, I think I was dwelling on it too much rather than focusing on how to tidy the data. My experience with <code>Ave_yy</code> columns just proves that summaries only hinder the data analysis<a href="#fnref1">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn2"><p><span class="citation">Ellis and Leek (2014)</span> also advocates ISO 8601 as the preffered date format for consistency and because the YYYY-MM-DD format is not misconstrued in Excel.
