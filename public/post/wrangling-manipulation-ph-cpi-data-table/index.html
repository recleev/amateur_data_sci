<h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> More Paths, More Knowledge</h1>
<p>In a series of <a href="https://amateurdatasci.rbind.io/post/messy-tidy-identify-split-geographic-scope/">posts</a>, I discussed how I turned a messy data, the <a href="http://openstat.psa.gov.ph/dataset/prices-and-related-indices">monthly Philippine consumer price index</a> to tidy data, using packages and functions in the <code>tidyverse</code>. I learned how to use <code>R</code> faster via the <code>tidyverse</code>, and I agree that for anyone going into data science with little or no knowledge about coding, <code>tidyverse</code> offers one of the easiest ways to learn <code>R</code>.</p>
<p>However, as I became more familiar and more comfortable with <code>R</code>, I realized there is a larger ecosystem of packages and functions outside of <code>tidyverse</code>. With &gt;13,000 packages in <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/available_packages_by_date.html">CRAN</a>, redundancy among packages and functions cannot be avoided, but I do not think this is a bad thing. The variety of packages in <code>R</code> allows for different approaches and philosophies<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> towards programming, data, and data science.</p>
<p>In this post, I do everything I did with the Philippine CPI data without the using <code>tidyverse</code>. This is not to say that <code>tidyverse</code> is insufficient. It has its weaknesses, but I think for the most common data science tasks, <code>tidyverse</code> covers a lot of user needs. However, this also does not mean that <code>tidyverse</code> is the only way or the most preferred approach. The <code>R</code> ecosystem may be as diverse<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> as its users.</p>
</div>
<div id="extension-of-data.frame" class="section level1">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Extension of data.frame</h1>
<p>We can do most of what we want to do with data using <code>{base}</code> <code>R</code> only. Packages in CRAN are tools that allow current and future users to learn from the past and what past users have done or found. This is just progress, and I think this is the strength of <code>R</code> as an open source software for statistical computing and graphics. Working with only <code>{base}</code> <code>R</code> is possible, but it will be difficult and limiting, I think, for any level of use<code>R</code>. Again, while <code>{base}</code> <code>R</code> may be sufficient for all of data science tasks for anyone who is very familiar with it, packages offer work arounds to common tasks.</p>
<p>After deciding to use a package, the next question for the use<code>R</code> is what package to use. For data manipulation, the most common go-to package is <code>dplyr</code>. However, this is not the only package that allows us to manipulate data, another package is <code>{data.table}</code><span class="citation">(Dowle and Srinivasan 2018)</span>, the extension of <code>data.frame</code>.</p>
<p>I really like <code>{data.table}</code>. It has a very different API compared to <code>dplyr</code>. It has its own advantages and disadvantages<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>, but I think it is one of the best packages out there when it comes to data manipulation.</p>
<p>I will repeat my process of transforming the Ph CPI data from the <a href="http://openstat.psa.gov.ph/">Philippine Statistics Authority</a> using <code>{data.table}</code><a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> as my main data manipulation tool.</p>
</div>
<div id="where-order-by-select-update-group-by" class="section level1">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">3</span> Where | Order By, Select | Update, Group By</h1>
<p>I don’t want this to be a tutorial about <code>{data.table}</code>. The <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/data.table/vignettes/datatable-intro.html">best tutorial</a> for <code>{data.table}</code> already exists. I will emphasize on the <code>{data.table}</code> syntax and explain why it is an extension of the <code>data.frame</code>.</p>
<p>With <code>{base}</code> <code>R</code>, we can subset or extract values from a <code>data.frame</code> object, <code>df</code>, using <code>df[rows, columns]</code> where <code>rows</code> is a vector of row indices or names and <code>columns</code> is a vector of column indices or names. In <code>{data.table}</code>, we can subset or extract values from a <code>{data.table}</code> object, <code>dt</code>, using <code>dt[i, j, by]</code>. <code>i</code> is a set of conditions to filter rows or columns we want to arrange the data with <code>order()</code>. <code>j</code> is a list of data transformations or summaries we want to do at specific columns. <code>by</code> is a list of columns we want the data transformations to be grouped. If the reader is familiar with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL">Structured Query Language</a> or SQL, <code>i</code> is equivalent to SQL’s <code>where</code> and <code>order by</code>, <code>j</code> to <code>select</code> and <code>update</code>, and <code>by</code> to <code>group by</code>. Again, please refer to <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/data.table/vignettes/datatable-intro.html">“Introduction to data.table”</a> for more information.</p>
<p>I prefer to use vertical <code>{data.table}</code> syntax.</p>
<pre><code>
dt[
  i,
  j,
  by
]
</code></pre>
<p>This vertical coding helps me review my code vertically too. I just find this way easier for me.</p>

<p>The things I did with the Ph CPI data are already discussed in my <a href="https://amateurdatasci.rbind.io/tags/consumer-price-index/">previous posts</a>. I will only translate them here in <code>{data.table}</code> syntax, so I will not repeat my reasons and thought processes. However, I will leave some comments on the functions I used. For the complete code, please refer to <a href="#code">6</a>.</p>
<div id="finagler" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Finagler</h2>
<p>We read the raw Ph CPI data using <code>data.table::fread()</code>. In the documentation, <code>data.table::fread()</code> is a fast and freindly file finagler<a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a>. The output is an object of <code>data.table</code> class.</p>

<p>Note that I am also using <code>%&gt;.%</code> from <code>wrapr</code> <span class="citation">(Mount and Zumel 2018)</span><a href="#fn6" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> for my pipes. It is just a strict version of <code>%&gt;%</code> from <code>magrittr</code>. It is stricter because it does not allow the user to leave the first argument of the function after the pipe empty, i.e. it requires the first argument to be specified as <code>.</code>, otherwise it throws an error that the first argument is missing. Again, I am only doing this because I want to try functions outside of the <code>tidyverse</code>.</p>

<p>To gather all the date columns into one, I used <code>data.table::melt()</code>. I also used <code>data.table:::patterns()</code> to specify the columns I want to gather. Converting the dates into <a href="https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html">ISO 8601</a> format (YYYY-MM-DD) is a bit trickier. First, I needed to separate the <code>month.abb_yy</code> to <code>month</code> and <code>year</code>. I did this using <code>data.table::tstrsplit()</code>. Second, I made a string YYYY-MM-DD using the <code>month</code> and <code>year</code> plus specifying the day as 1. I wanted to use the last day of the month, but I could not find a function outside the <code>tidyverse</code> that will allow me to do this.</p>

<p><code>data.table::tstrsplit()</code> becomes useful again in creating item codes by separating the <code>Code</code> column. Filtering and subsetting is really quick in <code>[data.table]</code>. It requires some getting used to, but once you get familiar with the syntax, the thinking and coding becomes quick and easy too. Combining <code>data.table</code>s using <code>merge()</code> was also very easy and intuitive.</p>

<h1><span class="header-section-number">5</span> The Power of Packages</h1>
<p><code>{data.table}</code> is a fun package to use. I am not yet familiar with all of its capabilities. I will use it more often<a href="#fn7" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a>, so I can learn its true potential.</p>
<p>Working with only a few packages and doing everything else with <code>{base}</code> <code>R</code> already accomplishes a lot of things. This encourages me to use as few packages as I can. However, I still think there are powerful packages and functions out there that people have already made, e.g. <code>{rebus}</code> <span class="citation">(Cotton 2017)</span>, that just makes data science easier. If I encountered a problem for at least <a href="https://twitter.com/drob/status/928447584712253440">three times</a> and solve it using the same code, I will make a function or even a package to relieve my future self some trouble.</p>
<p>Packages were and are being created to solve specific and recurring problems. Solving problems that were already solvedis a good practice and test, but in the battleground, knowledge of what has worked before can save time and maybe a life. There are redunduncies among packages. Choose well. Choose wisely.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>I just learned about <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/cdata/index.html">{cdata}</a>, coordinatized data, and fluid data transformations. The deeper you go into <code>R</code> the more you learn. It’s a multiverse out there.<a href="#fnref1">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn2"><p>Calling dibs on <code>diverseverse</code>.<a href="#fnref2">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn3"><p>Advantages and disadvantages are subjective. I once thought that the difficulty of learning <code>{data.table}</code> when I already know <code>dplyr</code>. Working with multitude types and sizes of data “forced” me to try <code>{data.table}</code>. After that, I regretted passing on <code>{data.table}</code> and not learning it sooner. I think the disadvantages are only an illusion whenever learning something new, while the advantages are not really that clear until one really experiences what one is missing out.<a href="#fnref3">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn4"><p>I am not an expert use<code>R</code> of <code>{data.table}</code>. I am still learning and getting familiar with the functions and nuances of <code>{data.table}</code>. I expect that I will use it more in the future, so I think this is good practice for me. The code I will use here may not be the most efficient, and I will always be open for improvements.<a href="#fnref4">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn5"><p>I do not know what finagler means. Merriam-Webster defines <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/finagle">finagle</a> as to obtain by indirect or involved means. I think <code>data.table::fread()</code> does that rather than obtain by trickery, although that sounds cooler.<a href="#fnref5">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn6"><p>I will probably explore <code>wrapr</code> more in the future.<a href="#fnref6">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn7"><p>I plan to use it more in future anyway as I expect to work with bigger and bigger data sets.<a href="#fnref7">↩</a></p></li>
