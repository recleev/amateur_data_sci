      <description>1 Problem2 SolutionReference1 ProblemProblem 49, page 189 in Simmons (2016)
Newton’s second law of motion
\[F = ma = m \frac{dv}{dt}\]
can be written in the form
\[\begin{equation}F = \frac{d \left( mv \right)}{dt} \tag{1.1}\end{equation}\]
in terms of the momentum \(mv\) of a particle of mass \(m\) and velocity \(v\), and remains valid even if \(m\) is not constant.</description>

      <description>Perpendicular Intersecting WavesProblemSolutionA Folded PaperProblemSolution: Minimum AreaSolution: Minimum Crease LengthSolution: Using R (Without Differentiations)Referencelibrary(knitr)library(tidyverse)library(ggthemes)opts_chunk$set(fig.align = &amp;quot;center&amp;quot;,message = FALSE,warning = FALSE)I found these two problems in Simmons (2016). I enjoyed these problems because they require more thinking than just a mechanical application of derivatives.
Perpendicular Intersecting WavesProblemThis problem appears in Simmons (2016) on page 119, item 24.</description>

      <description>Definition of a Tangent LineSlope of a Tangent Line on a CurveCondition for ExistenceLimit of an Absolute ValueProblemSolutionReferenceDefinition of a Tangent LineConsider a curve \(y = f(x)\), and let \(P\) be a given fixed point on this curve. Let \(Q\) be a second nearby point on the curve, and draw the secant line \(PQ\). The tangent line at \(P\) can now be thought of as the limiting position of the variable secant as \(Q\) slides along the curve toward \(P\).</description>
